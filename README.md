I'm  a Computer Engineer 🚀 currently, I'm an associate ML Engineer at Bottle Technology. Also, i am Blogger 🙍🏽‍♂️ @ [AIHUBPROJECTS.COM](https://aihubprojects.com), Freelancer 👨🏽‍💻.
 
My innate interest in Artificial Intelligence began when I found myself fascinated by the projects done by seniors in one of the hackathons I attended. Curiosity is the first and the foremost quality which drives a person towards learning new things. My interest, passion, dedication in learning AI, enabled me to acquire significant knowledge on Python and mathematics behind every ML algorithm.
 
I substantiated my knowledge by opening an instagram page and a website “aihubprojects.com” based on AI. My prodigious appetite for guiding others started from the moment I published my first python ebook on Amazon Kindle. This thrust spurred me to work assiduously and I published Machine Learning from Scratch tutorial series on my website. In the meantime, I created tutorials on various projects and shared them on Website as well as Instagram.
